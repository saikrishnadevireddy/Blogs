A bit intro into what Bayesian Optimization is: 
Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimize objective functions that take long time to evaluate.
It is best suited for continuous domains of less than 20 domains and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations.
It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainity in the surrogate using a Bayesian ML technique, Gaussian process regression and 
then uses a acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample.

Stochastic noise: In supervised learning, specifically when learning from  data, there are situations where data points cannot be modelled.
This may arise if there are random fluctuations or measurement errors in the data and are not modelled. 
When the phenomenon being modelled is too complex, the data contains this added complexity that is not modelled. 
This added complexity in the data has been called Deterministic noise.
